# WordMath
WordMath is a language-input detection-model that uses mathematical-calculations, and re-arranged-terms with definitions to calculate precise-interpretations of user-inputs, and system-outputs for any ai-chat, platform, or system that relies, or depends on natural-language-processing to read, and process language for prompt-engineering research.
